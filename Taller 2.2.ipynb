    "## Formato GFF3\n",
    "\n",
    "Is a format used for describing genes, and other feactures as DNA, RNA and Proteins.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format fields are the following:\n",
    "   \n",
    "seqname: name of the chromosome or scaffold; chromosome names can be given with or without the 'chr' prefix : Important note: the seqname must be one used within Ensembl, i.e. a standard chromosome name or an Ensembl identifier such as a scaffold ID, without any additional content such as species or assembly. See the example GFF output below.\n",
    "source : name of the program that generated this feature, or the data source (database or project name)\n",
    "feature : feature type name, e.g. Gene, Variation, Similarity\n",
    "start : Start position of the feature, with sequence numbering starting at 1.\n",
    "end: End position of the feature, with sequence numbering starting at 1.\n",
    "score: A floating point value.\n",
    "strand: defined as + (forward) or - (reverse).\n",
    "frame: One of '0', '1' or '2'. '0' indicates that the first base of the feature is the first base of a codon, '1' that the second base is the first base of a codon, and so on..\n",
    "attribute: A semicolon-separated list of tag-value pairs, providing additional information about each feature"
